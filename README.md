TROY's TRIVIA

Small web application which can be played with 3-9 players with one player acting as quizmaster using screenshare. 

The quizmaster will open the 'Home' page and enter the names of each player. They will then be navigated to the 'Quiz' page where players will select categories and anwer questions on those categories. Answers can be verified by the quizmaster on the 'Answer' page. This page should be opened in a separate screen which is not visible to the players. 

The quizmaster will click correct and wrong buttons based on player's answers and points will be awarded accordingly. Each question is worth 1 point initially but is incremented by 1 for every player that gets that question wrong. The player which answers the question correctly wins the points and chooses the next category. If all players answer the question wrong, the answer is revealed and the category is selected by the same player that selected it last. The quizmaster may also choose to award partial points if a player gives a half correct answer. In this scenario, the remaining points are awarded to which ever player gives the full answer. That player will also choose the next category.

Players have a time limit of 20s to answer each question. The overall quiz has a time limit of 30m. Once the overall time is reached, the quiz will end and the person with the highest points is declared as the winner.
